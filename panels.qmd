title: "Panels"
---

This page showcases panels implemented in [iSEE][bioc-iSEE] and its known extensions.

Panels are grouped by package in which their are implemented (see the floating table of contents on the right).

Each panel is introduced by a brief description above a single screenshot that illustrates a representative output,
and the code used to produce that particular panel output in a live app.

::: {.callout-note}
Bear in mind that all those panel classes come with many options to alter their respective outputs.
This gallery showcases only a fraction of what each of those panels can do.
In all likelihood, if a panel seems to do *almost* what you have in mind, then there are options to make it do *exactly* that.
Otherwise, options can be added, and more panel classes can be created; check out our [resources](./resources.html) to learn how!

## iSEE

### ColumnDataPlot

Visualise any combination of sample metadata stored in a [`SummarizedExperiment`][bioc-SummarizedExperiment] object.

## Reproduce This Output

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(iSEE)

library(scRNAseq)

# Example data ----
sce <- ReprocessedAllenData(assays="tophat_counts")

library(scater)
sce <- logNormCounts(sce, exprs_values="tophat_counts")

sce <- runPCA(sce, ncomponents=4)
sce <- runTSNE(sce)
sce <- runUMAP(sce)
rowData(sce)$ave_count <- rowMeans(assay(sce, "tophat_counts"))
rowData(sce)$n_cells <- rowSums(assay(sce, "tophat_counts") > 0)

# launch the app itself ----

app <- iSEE(sce, initial = list(
  ColumnDataPlot(
    PanelWidth = 8L,
    YAxis = "NREADS",
    XAxis = "Column data",
    XAxisColumnData = "driver_1_s",
    ColorBy = "Column data",
    ColorByColumnData = "driver_1_s",
    FacetColumnBy = "Column data",
    FacetColumnByColData = "Core.Type"
    )
))

if (interactive()) {
  shiny::runApp(app, port=1234)
}
```
