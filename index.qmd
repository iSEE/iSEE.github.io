[*iSEE*](https://bioconductor.org/packages/iSEE/) (interactive SummarizedExperiment Explorer) is an [**{{< fa star >}} award-winning**](https://posit.co/blog/first-shiny-contest-winners/) free open source R/Bioconductor package that produces an **interactive**, **multi-purpose**, and **thoroughly configurable** user interface for exploring data and metadata produced from virtually any biological assay.

Based on the **Bioconductor** [`SummarizedExperiment`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/SummarizedExperiment/) data structure, *iSEE* directly integrates in existing workflows.
The main function `iSEE()` only requires a `SummarizedExperiment` object to launch a full-featured [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) application, either locally for immediate exploration, or publicly for global dissemination.

A **clear single-page layout** allows end-users to intuitively (re-)arrange any number of panels showcasing different aspects of the data set, dynamically control the displayed information using a comprehensive set of **panel-specific widgets**, and **transmit selections** between panels to focus downstream analyses on specific data subsets.

*iSEE* boasts a **code tracker** reporting the *R* code necessary for reproducing all visible panel outputs and restoring the current app configuration at a later time.

*iSEE* **version 2.0.0** unlocked the possibility of developing independent third-party extension packages to add new designated classes of panels to the *iSEE* interface, with examples including [*iSEEindex*](https://bioconductor.org/packages/iSEEindex/), [*iSEEde*](https://bioconductor.org/packages/iSEEde/), [*iSEEpathways*](https://bioconductor.org/packages/iSEEpathways/), [*iSEEhex*](https://bioconductor.org/packages/iSEEhex/), and [*iSEEtree*](https://bioconductor.org/packages/iSEEtree/).

*iSEE* is actively maintained by a team of volunteers and aims to develop extensions for the support of **spatial omics** and **multi-omics** data sets in the near future.
